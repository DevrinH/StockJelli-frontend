        StockJelli is a free momentum screener for stocks and cryptocurrency. It scans the market every 60 seconds and surfaces the assets showing the strongest upward movement — filtered by percent change, volume, and market cap so you see signal, not noise.
      </p>

      <h2>Why We Built It</h2>
      <p>
        Most screeners are either too complicated or too cluttered. They're designed for power users who want 47 filters and a dozen chart overlays. That's great for some people, but for anyone who just wants to know "what's moving right now and why?" — it's overkill.
      </p>
      <p>
        StockJelli was built to answer that one question as cleanly as possible. Open the page, see what's running, check the volume and news, and move on. No account required. No paywall on the screener. No pop-ups asking you to upgrade before you've even seen the data.
      </p>

      <h2>What Makes StockJelli Different</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>It's focused.</strong> StockJelli does one thing — momentum screening — and tries to do it well. There's no charting engine, no portfolio tracker, no social feed. Just a clean list of what's moving with the context to understand why.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>It's fast.</strong> Data updates every 60 seconds during market hours. Crypto updates around the clock. The interface is lightweight and loads quickly even on mobile.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>It's honest.</strong> StockJelli is an educational tool. We don't hype stocks, we don't make predictions, and we don't pretend to know what's going to happen next. We show you what's happening now and let you do your own research.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        Under the hood, StockJelli pulls data from Financial Modeling Prep (stocks) and CoinGecko (crypto). Every minute, it filters for assets meeting these criteria:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stocks: 4%+ daily gain, 1M+ volume, $100M–$500B market cap</li>
        <li>Crypto: 3%+ gain over 24 hours, sufficient market cap and volume</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Stocks that meet the criteria appear on the screener with their price, percent change, volume, range position (where price sits between the day's high and low), and a link to related news when available. News headlines are sourced from Finnhub.
      </p>

      <h2>The Alerts</h2>
      <p>
        For users who want momentum data delivered to their inbox, StockJelli offers optional email alerts for $5/month. Alerts go out up to 4 times per day during key momentum windows and include only stocks and crypto that meet strict criteria — including range position near the day's high. This filters out names that are already fading.
      </p>
      <p>
        The alerts are the only paid feature. The screener itself is free and always will be.
      </p>

      <h2>Who's Behind It</h2>
      <p>
        StockJelli is an independent project built by a solo developer. No venture funding, no corporate parent, no editorial team telling us what to promote. It's built for people who want clean data without the noise — because that's what we wanted too.
