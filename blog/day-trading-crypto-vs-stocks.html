      <p>
        On the surface, day trading crypto and day trading stocks look like the same activity — you're watching charts, reading momentum, entering and exiting positions within a short timeframe. But the two markets have fundamentally different rules, structures, and barriers to entry that dramatically affect who can participate, how they trade, and what risks they face.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're deciding between the two — or if you already trade one and are curious about the other — here's a honest breakdown of how they compare.
      </p>

      <h2>The $25,000 Barrier: The PDT Rule</h2>
      <p>
        This is the single biggest difference between day trading stocks and crypto, and it's the reason many traders start with crypto instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the United States, FINRA's <strong>Pattern Day Trader (PDT) rule</strong> requires that anyone who executes four or more day trades within a five-business-day period in a margin account must maintain a minimum equity of $25,000. If your account drops below that threshold, your broker will restrict you from day trading until you deposit enough to get back above it.
      </p>
      <p>
        That means if you have a $5,000 or $10,000 account — which is where most new traders start — you're limited to three day trades per rolling five-day period on stocks. Three trades per week. That's it. You can swing trade (hold overnight) as many times as you want, but intraday in-and-out is capped.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Crypto has no PDT rule.</strong> Because crypto exchanges aren't regulated by FINRA, there's no minimum balance requirement and no limit on how many day trades you can make. You can open an account with $500 and make twenty trades a day if you want. This makes crypto significantly more accessible for traders who are starting with smaller accounts and want to actively trade.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't just a technicality — it fundamentally changes how you trade. With only three day trades per week on stocks, every entry has to count. You can't afford to take a speculative position and cut it quickly if it doesn't work, because that burns one of your precious day trades. In crypto, you have the freedom to be more tactical: enter, assess, exit if it's not working, and move on to the next setup without penalty.
      </p>

      <h2>Market Hours vs. 24/7</h2>
      <p>
        US stock markets operate on a fixed schedule: <strong>9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time, Monday through Friday</strong>. There's pre-market (4:00 AM – 9:30 AM) and after-hours (4:00 PM – 8:00 PM) trading available on most brokers, but liquidity is thin and spreads are wide during those sessions. For practical purposes, most stock day trading happens in a 6.5-hour window.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crypto markets <strong>never close</strong>. They trade 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year — including weekends, holidays, Christmas morning, and 3 AM on a Tuesday. There is no opening bell, no closing bell, no forced pause.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some traders, this is a massive advantage. If you have a day job and can't watch screens from 9:30 to 4:00, stock day trading is essentially off the table. Crypto lets you trade on your own schedule — early mornings, late nights, weekends. Some of the biggest crypto moves happen on Saturday and Sunday when stock markets are dark.
      </p>
      <p>
        But 24/7 markets are also a psychological trap. There's always a chart to watch, always a trade to consider, and no natural stopping point. Stock traders are forced to step away at 4:00 PM whether they want to or not. Crypto traders have to impose that discipline on themselves — and many don't. The result is overtrading, sleep deprivation, and emotional exhaustion. As we covered in our article on <a href="/blog/psychology-of-momentum-trading.html" style="color: #f0b90b;">trading psychology</a>, knowing when to stop is as important as knowing when to enter.
      </p>

      <h2>Capital Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond the PDT rule, the practical capital needed to day trade stocks versus crypto is very different.
      </p>
      <p>
        For stocks, even if you somehow bypass the PDT rule (cash account, offshore broker, etc.), you need enough capital to buy meaningful positions. A stock trading at $150/share requires $1,500 for just 10 shares. With <a href="/blog/position-sizing-why-small-wins-big.html" style="color: #f0b90b;">proper position sizing</a>, you need at least $10,000–$15,000 to trade stocks with any real flexibility — and $25,000+ to day trade freely.
      </p>
      <p>
        For crypto, you can start with a few hundred dollars. Most exchanges have no minimum deposit, and you can buy fractional amounts of any token. Want to put $50 into a position? That's fine. This low barrier makes crypto the natural starting point for traders who are learning with small capital. You can practice real trading with real money and real emotions without needing five figures in your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        The flip side is that small accounts in crypto are more vulnerable to fees eating into returns (more on that below) and the temptation to use excessive leverage to "make up" for the small account size — which is one of the fastest ways to blow up.
      </p>

      <h2>Volatility</h2>
      <p>
        Crypto is significantly more volatile than stocks, and this affects everything about how you trade.
      </p>
      <p>
        An average large-cap stock might move 1–2% on a normal day. A 4% move is unusual enough that StockJelli uses it as the minimum threshold for the stock screener. A 10% daily move on a stock is headline news.
      </p>
      <p>
        In crypto, a 4% daily move is Tuesday. Bitcoin routinely swings 3–5% in a single session, and altcoins can move 10–30% in hours. StockJelli's crypto screener uses a 3% minimum threshold — lower than stocks — and still surfaces more entries per day because the baseline volatility is that much higher.
      </p>
      <p>
        Higher volatility means bigger potential gains, but also bigger potential losses — and they happen faster. A stock position going against you by 2% gives you time to think and react. A crypto position going against you by 10% in fifteen minutes doesn't. This is why stop-losses and position sizing are even more critical in crypto than stocks. The margin for error is smaller because the speed of moves is faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        Volatility also means that strategies which work in stocks may need adjustment for crypto. A trailing stop of 3% works fine for most stock momentum trades. In crypto, a 3% trailing stop would get triggered by normal noise on almost every position. Crypto stops typically need to be wider — 5–10% depending on the token — which means position sizes need to be smaller to keep dollar risk the same.
      </p>

      <h2>Fees and Spreads</h2>
      <p>
        Most major stock brokers in the US now offer <strong>commission-free trading</strong> on equities. You can buy and sell stocks on platforms like Fidelity, Schwab, or Robinhood without paying a per-trade fee. There are still hidden costs (payment for order flow, margin interest) but the direct transaction cost is zero for most retail traders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crypto exchanges <strong>charge fees on every trade</strong> — typically 0.1% to 0.6% per transaction depending on the platform and your volume tier. That might sound small, but it adds up fast for active traders. If you're making ten round-trip trades a day at 0.2% per side, that's 4% of your capital eaten by fees daily. Over a month of active trading, fees alone can consume a significant portion of a small account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spreads matter too. On liquid stocks during market hours, the bid-ask spread is typically pennies — fractions of a percent. On smaller crypto tokens, the spread can be 0.5–1% or more, which means you're starting every trade slightly underwater. For momentum trades on low-cap altcoins, the combined cost of fees plus spread can easily be 1–2% round trip, which eats directly into your edge.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is one area where stocks have a clear advantage for active day traders. Zero-commission trading with tight spreads means your strategy only needs to overcome the market itself — not a fee structure working against you on every trade.
      </p>

      <h2>Regulation and Protection</h2>
      <p>
        When you trade stocks through a US broker, your account is protected by <strong>SIPC insurance</strong> up to $500,000. Your broker is regulated by FINRA and the SEC. There are rules against market manipulation, insider trading, and fraud. Trade execution is governed by best-execution requirements. None of this guarantees you'll make money, but it means the playing field has enforceable rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crypto operates in a <strong>much less regulated environment</strong>. Most crypto exchanges are not SIPC-insured. If an exchange is hacked, goes bankrupt, or simply freezes withdrawals, your funds may not be recoverable. Market manipulation (wash trading, spoofing, pump-and-dump schemes) is more prevalent because the enforcement mechanisms that exist in traditional markets are largely absent in crypto.
      </p>
      <p>
        This doesn't mean crypto is lawless — regulation is increasing and major exchanges implement their own security measures. But the level of protection is meaningfully lower than traditional stock brokerage accounts. This is why many experienced crypto traders keep the majority of their holdings in self-custody wallets and only keep active trading capital on exchanges.
      </p>

      <h2>Information and Catalysts</h2>
      <p>
        Stock momentum is typically driven by well-documented catalysts — earnings reports published on SEC filings, analyst upgrades from major banks, FDA decisions, economic data releases. This information is widely distributed through financial media and is (in theory) available to everyone simultaneously. You can quickly understand <em>why</em> a stock is moving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crypto catalysts are harder to track and often travel through informal channels first. A protocol upgrade might be announced on a project's Discord server. A whale wallet movement might show up on on-chain analytics tools before any news outlet reports it. Exchange listings are sometimes leaked on Telegram hours before the official announcement. By the time crypto catalysts reach mainstream financial news, the move has often already happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        This information asymmetry is both a risk and an opportunity. It's a risk because you're more likely to be buying into a move where insiders already have positions. It's an opportunity because if you develop good information sources — following the right accounts, monitoring on-chain data, watching StockJelli's crypto screener for emerging moves — you can get in before the broader market catches on.
      </p>
      <p>
        StockJelli handles this difference by showing a <strong>news column</strong> for stock entries (linking to the catalyst) and a <strong>market cap column</strong> for crypto entries (since catalyst information may not be available through traditional news). This design reflects the reality that the two markets have fundamentally different information ecosystems.
      </p>

      <h2>Tax Implications</h2>
      <p>
        Both stock and crypto day trading profits are taxable, but there are some important differences in how they're treated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stock day trading profits are taxed as <strong>short-term capital gains</strong> (your ordinary income tax rate) if held less than a year. Your broker provides a consolidated 1099 form at year-end that makes tax reporting relatively straightforward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crypto taxes work on the same short-term/long-term capital gains framework, but <strong>reporting is more complex</strong>. Every single trade — including crypto-to-crypto swaps — is a taxable event. If you're making dozens of trades per day across multiple exchanges, tracking your cost basis and realized gains can become a serious accounting challenge. Dedicated crypto tax software (like Koinly, CoinTracker, or TaxBit) is almost a necessity for active crypto traders.
      </p>
      <p>
        One nuance worth noting: the <strong>wash sale rule</strong>, which prevents stock traders from selling at a loss and immediately rebuying to claim a tax deduction, currently does not apply to crypto in the same way (though legislation may change this). This gives crypto traders slightly more flexibility in tax-loss harvesting — but don't make tax strategy a reason to enter bad trades.
      </p>

      <h2>Which Is Better for Beginners?</h2>
      <p>
        There's no single right answer, but here's an honest assessment:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Crypto is more accessible.</strong> No PDT rule, low capital requirements, 24/7 hours that fit any schedule. If you have $500–$2,000 and want to learn active trading with real money, crypto is the practical option. You'll get more at-bats, more experience, and more data about your own trading behavior than stocks would allow with the same capital.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Stocks are more structured.</strong> Fixed hours force you to have a routine. Commission-free trading means fees aren't eating your edge. The regulatory environment provides protections. Catalysts are well-documented. The PDT rule, while frustrating, actually forces small-account traders to be selective — which, counterintuitively, can develop better habits than the unlimited freedom of crypto.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest risk for beginners in crypto is the combination of 24/7 access, high volatility, and leverage. It's very easy to overtrade, stay up too late chasing positions, and use leverage that amplifies losses beyond what your account can absorb. The accessibility that makes crypto appealing is also what makes it dangerous for traders who haven't developed discipline yet.
      </p>

      <div class="blog-callout">
        <div class="blog-callout-title">📊 Key Takeaway</div>
        <p style="margin:0; color: rgba(255,255,255,0.65); font-size: 0.9rem;">
          Stocks require $25,000 to day trade freely (PDT rule), trade during fixed hours, offer commission-free execution, and operate in a heavily regulated environment. Crypto has no minimum balance, trades 24/7, charges fees on every transaction, and offers less regulatory protection. Neither is objectively "better" — the right choice depends on your capital, schedule, risk tolerance, and discipline. Many active traders eventually trade both, using StockJelli's stock and crypto tabs to monitor momentum across both markets.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Using StockJelli Across Both</h2>
      <p>
        One of the reasons StockJelli was built with both a stocks tab and a crypto tab is that many traders are active in both markets — or are transitioning from one to the other. The screener applies different criteria to each (different percentage thresholds, different volume requirements, different columns) because what constitutes a meaningful signal is different in each market.
      </p>
      <p>
        A practical workflow: during US market hours, focus on the stocks tab for intraday momentum. After 4:00 PM and on weekends, switch to the crypto tab. This gives you coverage across both markets without the need for multiple platforms, and the <a href="/blog/market-regime-indicator.html" style="color: #f0b90b;">Market Regime Indicator</a> tells you whether each environment is currently favorable for momentum strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of which market you trade, the fundamentals are the same: find moves backed by volume, manage your risk, have an exit plan, and don't let emotions drive your decisions. The asset class changes; the discipline doesn't.
