        StockJelli surfaces stocks and crypto showing unusual upward momentum. But what do the numbers actually mean, and how should you read them? This guide walks you through every column in the screener so you can make faster, more informed decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>Percent Change — The Core Signal</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>% Change</strong> column is the primary filter. For stocks, only tickers up <strong>4% or more</strong> on the day make the list. For crypto, the threshold is <strong>3%+ over 24 hours</strong>. These thresholds filter out normal market noise and surface only meaningful moves.
      </p>
      <p>
        A stock up 4% might not sound dramatic, but remember — StockJelli also requires minimum volume and market cap thresholds. A 4% move on a $200M company with 2M shares traded is a very different signal than a 4% move on a penny stock with 50K volume.
      </p>

      <h2>Volume — Confirms the Move Is Real</h2>
      <p>
        Volume is what separates real momentum from noise. StockJelli requires a minimum of <strong>1 million in trading volume</strong> for a stock to appear. High volume means institutional participation — large players are moving the stock, not just retail noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you see a stock up 8% on 15M volume, that's a confirmed move. When you see one up 8% on 200K volume, that's likely a thin, illiquid name that could reverse just as fast.
      </p>

      <h2>Market Cap — The Right Sandbox</h2>
      <p>
        StockJelli defaults to a market cap range of <strong>$100M to $500B</strong>. This excludes micro-caps (where manipulation is common) and mega-caps (where 4% moves are extremely rare and usually macro-driven).
      </p>
      <p>
        The sweet spot for momentum trading tends to be <strong>$300M–$10B</strong> — large enough to have real liquidity, small enough to make outsized moves on catalysts.
      </p>

      <h2>Range Position — Where Price Sits Today</h2>
      <p>
        The range slider next to each ticker shows where the current price sits between the day's low and high. A dot near the <strong>right side</strong> (near the high) means the stock is holding near its peak — strength is intact. A dot drifting <strong>left</strong> means it's pulling back from highs, which could signal fading momentum.
      </p>

        <div class="blog-callout-title">💡 Pro Tip</div>
        <p style="margin:0; color: rgba(255,255,255,0.65); font-size: 0.9rem;">
          Stocks near the day's high with rising volume are the strongest momentum signals. StockJelli's email alerts specifically filter for tickers in the <strong>top 70%+ of their daily range</strong>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>News Column — The Catalyst</h2>
      <p>
        When available, StockJelli links to recent news from <strong>tier 1 sources</strong> (Bloomberg, Reuters, WSJ, CNBC) and <strong>tier 2 sources</strong> (MarketWatch, Seeking Alpha, Benzinga). A momentum move backed by a clear catalyst — earnings beat, FDA approval, partnership announcement — is generally more sustainable than one with no visible driver.
      </p>
      <p>
        No news doesn't automatically mean "avoid." Some moves are driven by sector rotation, short squeezes, or technical breakouts that don't generate headlines. But having a catalyst gives you more conviction.
      </p>

      <h2>The "NEW" Badge</h2>
      <p>
        Tickers that just entered the screener in the current session are tagged <strong>NEW</strong>. These are the freshest momentum plays — they just crossed the threshold. Early entries often have the most upside remaining, but also the highest uncertainty.
      </p>

      <h2>Cooled Stocks</h2>
      <p>
        If a stock was on the screener earlier today but has since pulled back below the minimum % change threshold, it stays visible as a <strong>"cooled"</strong> entry (slightly dimmed). This lets you track names that were in play even if they've faded — useful for watching potential re-entries.
      </p>

      <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
      <p>
        The strongest signals combine multiple factors: high percent change, above-average volume, price near the day's high, and a clear news catalyst. Not every trade needs all four, but the more boxes a ticker checks, the cleaner the setup.
      </p>
