    <div class="blog-body">
      <p>
        If you checked the crypto screener this weekend, you saw the meme coin section light up. PEPE, DOGE, FARTCOIN, and a wave of smaller tokens surged — some with double-digit gains — before many started fading back toward where they started. This is the weekend meme coin cycle in action, and understanding it is the difference between catching a move and becoming someone else's exit liquidity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's what happened, why it happened, and what to watch for when the next one inevitably comes around.
      </p>

      <h2>What Moved</h2>
      <p>
        The catalyst was Bitcoin. BTC pushed back above $70,000 this weekend after encouraging US consumer inflation data showed both headline and core CPI fell in January. When Bitcoin moves with conviction, risk appetite floods back into the rest of the crypto market — and meme coins, being the highest-beta assets in the space, tend to move the fastest.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>PEPE</strong> has been the standout. The token rebounded roughly 60% from its February 6 low of $0.0000031 to around $0.0000050 by Sunday — its highest level since late January. Trading volume on PEPE crossed $1 billion in 24 hours, and open interest in PEPE futures rose to over $300 million, up from $194 million earlier in the month. That kind of volume and derivatives activity means this wasn't just retail chatter — there was real capital rotating in.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DOGE</strong> followed a similar pattern, jumping roughly 20% from its February lows. As the largest meme coin by market cap, DOGE tends to move first in meme rotations and serves as a bellwether for the sector. When DOGE is running, traders take it as a signal to look down the cap scale for bigger percentage moves.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>FARTCOIN</strong> — the Solana-based meme coin that's become a consistent participant in meme rallies — also saw a weekend spike. FARTCOIN has established itself as a mid-tier meme asset with enough liquidity (listed on major CEXs and Solana DEXs) to attract fast-rotating capital.
      </p>
      <p>
        The broader meme coin sector jumped over 12% in 24 hours, with total meme coin market cap climbing from around $29 billion to $35 billion. StockJelli's crypto screener reflected this directly: Saturday logged <strong>248 entries</strong> and Sunday <strong>203 entries</strong> — compared to a Monday-through-Wednesday average of just 28 per day earlier in the week.
      </p>

      <h2>The Weekend Meme Cycle</h2>
      <p>
        This pattern repeats so consistently it's almost a playbook. Here's how the weekend meme coin cycle typically works:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Stage 1: BTC moves.</strong> A Bitcoin breakout — whether driven by macro news, technical levels, or just weekend thin-liquidity momentum — sets the tone. BTC above a round number ($70K this time) flips sentiment from cautious to risk-on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Stage 2: Large-cap alts follow.</strong> ETH, SOL, and other major altcoins start moving within hours. This is when the "crypto is back" narrative starts building on social media.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Stage 3: Meme rotation begins.</strong> DOGE leads (it always leads — it's the most liquid meme token). PEPE and SHIB follow. Traders see these moves and start scanning for the next meme with momentum.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Stage 4: Mid and small-cap meme explosion.</strong> FARTCOIN, BONK, WIF, FLOKI, and smaller tokens surge as capital cascades down the market cap ladder. This is where the biggest percentage gains happen — and also where the biggest reversals occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Stage 5: The fade.</strong> Weekend liquidity is thinner than weekday liquidity. Gains that look explosive on Saturday morning often retrace by Sunday evening as the initial wave of buying exhausts itself and profit-taking begins. Traders who bought the Stage 4 surge at the highs are left holding positions that are already underwater.
      </p>
      <p>
        This weekend followed that pattern almost exactly. The question is always: did you catch Stage 2–3, or did you FOMO in at Stage 4?
      </p>

      <h2>Why Meme Coins Move on Weekends</h2>
      <p>
        There's a structural reason meme coins disproportionately move on weekends, and it's not just "people are bored."
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditional stock markets are closed Saturday and Sunday. That means the pool of liquid, tradeable assets shrinks — anyone who wants to trade is limited to crypto. This concentrates attention and capital into a smaller number of assets. At the same time, market-maker depth on crypto exchanges tends to thin out over weekends, meaning less capital is required to move prices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result: the same amount of buying pressure that would barely move a stock on a Wednesday afternoon can push a meme coin up 15% on a Saturday night. Thin liquidity amplifies everything — both the pumps and the dumps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add social media to the mix — crypto Twitter and Telegram are more active on weekends when people aren't at work — and you get a feedback loop: price moves → social media hype → more buying → bigger price moves → more hype. Until it reverses.
      </p>

      <h2>What StockJelli Saw</h2>
      <p>
        The screener data from this weekend tells a clear story. From Monday through Wednesday, the crypto tab averaged about <strong>28 entries per day</strong>. Then:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Thursday:</strong> 224 entries</li>
        <li><strong>Friday:</strong> 234 entries</li>
        <li><strong>Saturday:</strong> 248 entries</li>
        <li><strong>Sunday:</strong> 203 entries (and counting)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That's an 8x increase from early-week levels. The screener went from a quiet, selective mode to a full cascade. Among the top entries: Berachain (BERA) peaked at +201%, Magic Eden (ME) at +80.6%, Toshi (TOSHI) at +66.8%, and Venice Token (VVV) hit the screener twice — once on Friday at +61.7% and again today at +60.8%.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is exactly the scenario where the <a href="/blog/market-regime-indicator.html" style="color: #f0b90b;">Market Regime Indicator</a> becomes critical. When entry counts spike this dramatically, the market is in a clear momentum expansion phase. The regime indicator helps you distinguish between "lots of things are moving because the tide is rising" versus "the market is quiet and only a few outliers are running."
      </p>

      <h2>The Lesson: Meme Pumps Aren't Breakouts</h2>
      <p>
        Here's the uncomfortable truth about meme coin surges: the vast majority of them don't sustain. The same volatility that delivers +30% gains in 12 hours can deliver -30% in the next 12. Meme coins don't have earnings, revenue, products, or cash flow. Their price is driven entirely by attention and capital flow — both of which are fickle.
      </p>
      <p>
        That doesn't mean you can't trade them profitably. But it means you have to approach them differently than you'd approach a stock with a genuine catalyst or a crypto protocol with real usage metrics. Here's what that looks like in practice:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Size down.</strong> Meme coins should be your smallest positions, not your largest. The potential for 50% drawdowns in a single session is real. As we covered in our <a href="/blog/position-sizing-why-small-wins-big.html" style="color: #f0b90b;">position sizing guide</a>, risking 1–2% of your account per trade is the rule — and for meme coins, err toward the lower end.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Take profits quickly.</strong> Meme moves are fast-in, fast-out. If you're up 20% on a meme trade, that might be the trade. Holding for another 20% often means giving back the first 20%. Set exits before you enter.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Watch for the volume drop.</strong> The 🔥 volume surge indicator on StockJelli exists for exactly this reason. When a meme coin is surging with genuine volume behind it, the fire emoji confirms real participation. When the volume starts fading while price is still elevated, that's your signal that the move is running out of fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Don't chase Stage 4.</strong> If you're reading about a meme coin pump on Twitter on Sunday afternoon, you've already missed the early move. Buying the hype after it's already been amplified across social media is how traders become exit liquidity. The screener is designed to surface these moves early — not after they've already run.
      </p>

      <div class="blog-callout">
        <div class="blog-callout-title">📊 Key Takeaway</div>
        <p style="margin:0; color: rgba(255,255,255,0.65); font-size: 0.9rem;">
          Meme coins surged this weekend as BTC broke above $70K and risk appetite returned to the market. PEPE rallied 60% from its February low, DOGE jumped 20%, and the total meme sector added $6 billion in market cap. StockJelli's screener saw 451 crypto entries over Saturday and Sunday alone — up from an average of 28/day earlier in the week. But weekend meme pumps run on thin liquidity and social media hype — they fade as quickly as they form. Trade them if you want, but size small, take profits fast, and never chase.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>What Happens Next</h2>
      <p>
        Monday is the tell. If BTC holds above $70K and these meme coins retain at least half their weekend gains through Monday's session, that suggests the move has legs beyond a weekend liquidity event. If BTC pulls back and meme coins dump 10–15% Monday morning, the weekend was just noise — fun to watch, dangerous to chase.
      </p>
      <p>
        StockJelli's crypto tab will continue updating through the weekend and into Monday. Watch the entry counts: if the screener stays elevated with 100+ entries per day, momentum is sustained. If it drops back toward 20–30, the wave is over and it's time to wait for the next one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Either way, the pattern will repeat. Meme coins pump on weekends, social media amplifies the narrative, and the cycle continues. The traders who consistently profit from these moves are the ones who see the screener data early, enter with a plan, and exit before the crowd realizes the party is winding down.
