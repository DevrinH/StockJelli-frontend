      <p>
        Not all screeners are built for the same trader. StockJelli, Finviz, and MOMO Pro are three of the most commonly mentioned tools for finding momentum stocks — but they're designed around fundamentally different philosophies, workflows, and types of traders. This isn't a "we're the best" article. It's an honest breakdown of what each tool does well, where it falls short, and who it's actually built for.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're trying to decide between them — or wondering whether you need more than one — here's how they compare.
      </p>

      <h2>Finviz: The Research Encyclopedia</h2>
      <p>
        Finviz has been around for years and it's earned its reputation. If you need to filter the entire US stock market by dozens of technical and fundamental criteria — P/E ratio, RSI level, chart pattern, market cap range, average volume, insider trading activity — Finviz is the tool. It's essentially a database with a screener bolted on top, and the depth of its filtering capabilities is unmatched.
      </p>
      <p>
        The S&P 500 heatmap is iconic. The hover-to-see-chart feature lets you visually scan hundreds of stocks in minutes. And the sheer volume of data Finviz aggregates — news, insider transactions, analyst ratings, SEC filings — makes it genuinely useful for fundamental research beyond just screening.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Where Finviz shines:</strong> discovery and breadth. If your question is "show me every stock under $10 with an RSI below 30 and a rising 50-day moving average," Finviz can do that. No other free tool gives you that level of granular filtering.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Where Finviz struggles:</strong> the free version runs on a 15–20 minute data delay and is heavily ad-supported — banner ads, sidebar ads, pop-ups. The interface is information-dense to the point of being cluttered, especially for newer traders who don't yet know which of the 70+ filter options actually matter. And Finviz is stocks-only — no crypto coverage at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Pricing:</strong> Free tier with delayed data and ads. Finviz Elite runs $39.50/month for real-time data, premarket quotes, and an ad-free experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Finviz psychology:</strong> "Let me search everything." It's for traders who want maximum control over their screening criteria and are comfortable building complex multi-filter queries. If you know exactly what you're looking for, Finviz is the best tool for finding it.
      </p>

      <h2>MOMO Pro: The Real-Time Alert Stream</h2>
      <p>
        MOMO takes the opposite approach from a traditional screener. Instead of <em>you</em> searching for stocks, MOMO streams stocks <em>to you</em> as they make momentum moves in real time. New 52-week highs, volume spikes, breakouts — the MOMO Stream is a continuous feed of tickers making moves right now, across all US exchanges, updated by the second.
      </p>
      <p>
        The interface is built around this stream. It's mobile-optimized and designed for the "always-on" trader who wants to catch moves as they initiate. MOMO's "heat" indicators show whether a stock is being traded heavily, giving you a fast visual cue about participation levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Where MOMO shines:</strong> speed and alerting. If you're a day trader or scalper who needs to know the exact moment a stock breaks out of a range or hits a new high, MOMO is purpose-built for that. The stream format means you're seeing opportunities the moment they trigger, not after they've already run.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Where MOMO struggles:</strong> context. The stream tells you <em>what</em> is moving but doesn't do much to tell you <em>how strong</em> the move is relative to other factors, or whether the broader market environment supports the trade. It's also stocks-only — no crypto. And the stream format can feel overwhelming during high-activity sessions when dozens of tickers are firing simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Pricing:</strong> MOMO Pro runs roughly $10–$20/month depending on the plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The MOMO psychology:</strong> "What is moving right now?" It's for day traders who live in the market session and need sub-second awareness of breakouts. If your edge is reaction speed, MOMO gives you the feed.
      </p>

      <h2>StockJelli: The Clean Momentum Screener</h2>
      <p>
        StockJelli was built to answer a specific question that neither Finviz nor MOMO directly addresses: <em>"What's strong right now, how strong is it, and should I care?"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The core of StockJelli is the <a href="/blog/what-is-sj-score.html" style="color: #f0b90b;">SJ Score</a> — a proprietary 1–10 ranking that takes the variables momentum traders care about (price change, volume, range position, market cap) and collapses them into a single number. Instead of scanning a table of raw data and mentally calculating whether a 15% move on 3M shares in a $500M company is better than an 8% move on 12M shares in a $2B company, the SJ Score does that math for you. A 9 is stronger than a 6. That's it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The design philosophy is intentionally minimal. No banner ads. No 70-filter dropdowns. No stream of tickers firing at you every second. StockJelli shows you what's moving, ranks it by strength, and gives you the context to decide whether the setup fits your criteria. The <a href="/blog/momentum-river.html" style="color: #f0b90b;">Momentum River</a> visualization adds an at-a-glance layer — you can literally see which lanes are flowing fastest and how individual movers compare to the broader market index.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Where StockJelli shines:</strong> actionable clarity. The SJ Score eliminates the mental overhead of comparing multiple variables across multiple stocks. The <a href="/blog/market-regime-indicator.html" style="color: #f0b90b;">Market Regime Indicator</a> tells you whether the environment supports momentum trading. And StockJelli covers both stocks and crypto in a single interface — a toggle switch on the same page, same layout, same scoring system. Neither Finviz nor MOMO offers crypto coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Where StockJelli is more limited:</strong> it's a momentum-specific tool, not a general-purpose research platform. You can't filter by P/E ratio, chart pattern, or insider activity like you can on Finviz. You won't get sub-second breakout alerts like MOMO. StockJelli deliberately trades breadth for clarity — it shows you fewer things, but what it shows you is pre-filtered and scored.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Pricing:</strong> The screener is free. Email alerts and subscriber features (regime-adjusted SJ Scores, weekly reports) are $5/month.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The StockJelli psychology:</strong> "Just show me what's strong." It's for momentum and swing traders who want a clean workflow that cuts through the noise and surfaces the highest-strength setups without requiring expert-level filter configuration.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Should Use What</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Use Finviz if</strong> you need deep fundamental and technical research. If your workflow involves building custom screeners with specific P/E ranges, float percentages, and chart pattern recognition, Finviz is the tool. It's also the best free option for basic stock research — as long as you can tolerate the ads and the data delay on the free tier. Finviz is the place to go when you want to understand <em>why</em> a stock might move, based on its financials and technical setup.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Use MOMO if</strong> you're an active day trader or scalper who needs to see breakouts the moment they happen. If your trading session involves watching a live feed and reacting within seconds to volume spikes and new highs, MOMO's stream is purpose-built for that speed. It's the tool for traders whose edge is being fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Use StockJelli if</strong> you want momentum trading simplified. If you find Finviz overwhelming and MOMO too frantic, StockJelli sits in the middle — showing you what's strong without requiring you to build complex filters or react in milliseconds. The SJ Score does the ranking, the Market Regime tells you whether the environment supports the trade, and the clean layout means you can assess the entire market in under a minute. It's also the only option of the three that covers both stocks and crypto.
      </p>

      <h2>Can You Use More Than One?</h2>
      <p>
        Absolutely — and many traders do. These tools aren't mutually exclusive. A practical multi-tool workflow might look like:
      </p>
      <p>
        Use <strong>StockJelli</strong> as your primary screener for identifying high-strength momentum setups across stocks and crypto. When something scores well on the SJ Score, use <strong>Finviz</strong> to dig into the fundamentals — what's the float, the P/E, the insider activity? Is there a fundamental reason this stock is moving, or is it purely technical? And if you're day trading the open, run <strong>MOMO</strong> alongside for real-time breakout alerts during the session.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each tool has a purpose. The mistake isn't using the wrong tool — it's expecting one tool to do everything. Finviz can't score momentum for you. MOMO can't show you crypto. StockJelli can't filter by insider ownership. Know what you need, use the right tool for it, and don't pay for features you don't use.
      </p>

      <div class="blog-callout">
        <div class="blog-callout-title">📊 Bottom Line</div>
        <p style="margin:0; color: rgba(255,255,255,0.65); font-size: 0.9rem;">
          Finviz is for research. MOMO is for speed. StockJelli is for clarity. If you want a scored, ranked, ad-free momentum screener that covers both stocks and crypto at $5/month — that's StockJelli. If you need fundamental depth or sub-second alerting, complement it with Finviz or MOMO. No single tool does everything, and the best traders know when to use which.
