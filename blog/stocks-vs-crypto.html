      <p>
        Momentum screening works for both stocks and crypto, but the two asset classes behave very differently. Understanding these differences can help you interpret StockJelli's screener data more effectively — and know what to pay attention to depending on which tab you're looking at.
      </p>

      <h2>Market Hours vs. 24/7</h2>
      <p>
        The most obvious difference: stocks trade during fixed hours (9:30 AM – 4:00 PM ET, Monday through Friday), while crypto trades nonstop — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including holidays.
      </p>
      <p>
        For stocks, this means momentum is concentrated. The first 30–60 minutes after open (the "morning session") produces the majority of breakout entries. By midday, many moves have already played out or are fading. StockJelli's stock screener is most active during this window.
      </p>
      <p>
        For crypto, momentum can emerge at any time. Weekend rallies are common, and some of the biggest moves happen during off-hours when traditional markets are closed. StockJelli's crypto screener updates around the clock to catch these moves regardless of timing.
      </p>

      <h2>What "Volume" Means in Each</h2>
      <p>
        On the stocks screener, <strong>volume</strong> represents the number of shares traded. StockJelli requires a minimum of 1 million shares to filter out illiquid names. High volume on a stock breakout generally indicates institutional participation — funds, algorithms, and professional traders are involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the crypto screener, <strong>volume</strong> represents the total dollar value traded over 24 hours. The interpretation is different because crypto volume includes global exchanges, retail-heavy platforms, and sometimes wash trading. A useful heuristic: compare the 24-hour volume to the coin's market cap. A volume-to-market-cap ratio above 0.5 suggests genuine interest. Ratios above 2.0 can indicate extreme speculation.
      </p>

      <h2>Percentage Thresholds</h2>
      <p>
        StockJelli uses different thresholds for each asset class, and there's a good reason for it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stocks:</strong> 4%+ daily gain required. A 4% move on an individual stock in a single session is notable — it's roughly 4–5x the average daily move of most equities.</li>
        <li><strong>Crypto:</strong> 3%+ over 24 hours. Crypto is inherently more volatile, so a lower threshold still captures meaningful moves without being flooded with normal price fluctuation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Even with these adjusted thresholds, crypto tends to produce more screener entries per day than stocks — simply because the market is larger (thousands of tokens) and more volatile.
      </p>

      <h2>Catalysts Look Different</h2>
      <p>
        Stock momentum is typically driven by identifiable catalysts: earnings reports, analyst upgrades, FDA approvals, partnership announcements, sector rotation, or macro data releases. These catalysts are well-covered by financial media, which is why StockJelli links to news sources for stock entries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crypto catalysts are more varied and harder to track. They include: exchange listings, protocol upgrades, airdrop announcements, governance proposals, whale wallet movements, and sometimes just social media attention. Many crypto moves have no immediately visible catalyst in traditional news — the information travels through Twitter/X, Discord, and Telegram before it reaches aggregators.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why StockJelli shows a <strong>Market Cap</strong> column on the crypto screener instead of a news column. Market cap helps you quickly gauge the scale and relative risk of a token, since catalyst information may not be readily available through standard news feeds.
      </p>

      <h2>How BTC Affects Everything</h2>
      <p>
        In crypto, there's a correlation dynamic that doesn't exist in stocks. When Bitcoin moves significantly (5%+ in a day), it tends to pull the entire market with it — but on a delay. Altcoins typically lag BTC breakouts by 12–48 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that after a big BTC day, you'll often see StockJelli's crypto screener light up with altcoin entries the following day. This pattern — BTC leads, alts follow — is one of the more consistent behaviors in crypto markets and is worth keeping in mind when reviewing the screener.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stocks don't have this same single-asset correlation. While sector rotation exists (tech stocks may move together, for example), there's no single stock that pulls the entire market the way BTC influences crypto.
      </p>

      <h2>Holding Period Expectations</h2>
      <p>
        Momentum in stocks tends to be more structured. A stock that gaps up on earnings might hold its gains for days or weeks as analysts adjust price targets. The move is often "anchored" by fundamental data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crypto momentum is typically faster and more volatile. A 30% move can reverse to +5% within hours. The lack of market close means there's no overnight gap protection — but also no artificial suppression of selling pressure. Moves play out continuously.
      </p>

      <div class="blog-callout">
        <div class="blog-callout-title">📊 Key Takeaway</div>
        <p style="margin:0; color: rgba(255,255,255,0.65); font-size: 0.9rem;">
          Stock momentum is concentrated in fixed-hour sessions and driven by identifiable catalysts. Crypto momentum runs 24/7, is influenced by BTC, and often moves faster with less visible catalysts. Both show up on StockJelli's screener — but understanding these differences helps you interpret the data more effectively.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Using StockJelli for Both</h2>
      <p>
        StockJelli's toggle between Stocks and Crypto isn't just a UI feature — it reflects two fundamentally different markets. The screener applies different criteria to each because what constitutes a meaningful move is different in each asset class.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stocks tab is most useful during US market hours, especially the first 90 minutes. The crypto tab is useful at any time, but particularly active during and after BTC moves and on weekends when stock markets are closed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of which tab you're viewing, the core principle is the same: unusual upward movement, backed by volume, above a minimum market cap. That's the signal StockJelli is designed to surface.
