        Here's a look at the crypto assets that showed the strongest momentum on StockJelli's screener this week. This report recaps what moved, the volume behind it, and how screener activity broke down by day. All data is pulled directly from StockJelli's screener logs.
      </p>

      <h2>Week Overview</h2>
      <p>
        StockJelli's crypto screener flagged <strong>272 unique coins</strong> across <strong>603 total entries</strong> this week. Average peak 24h gain at screener entry was <strong>+9.2%</strong> — down slightly from last week's +10.8%, though the top movers this week were significantly stronger. The week featured a dramatic activity spike on Friday, with 210 entries in a single day.
      </p>

        <div class="blog-paywall-blurred" id="paywallBlurred">

          <h2>Top 3 Screener Entries This Week</h2>
          <p>Ranked by peak 24-hour percentage gain at the time each coin appeared on StockJelli's screener.</p>

          <h3>1. AZTEC — peaked at +98.6% (24h)</h3>
          <p>
            Entered the screener on Friday. Price at entry: $0.0195. Peak price: $0.0372. 24h volume at entry: $24.0M. Market cap: $56.4M. Range position at entry: 57%. A small-cap token that nearly doubled from its entry price, with a mid-range entry suggesting the move still had room when the screener flagged it. The volume-to-market-cap ratio of 0.43 indicated elevated but not extreme speculative interest.
          </p>

          <h3>2. MYX (MYX Finance) — peaked at +89.0% (24h)</h3>
          <p>
            Entered the screener on Friday. Price at entry: $0.984. Peak price: $1.816. 24h volume at entry: $49.6M. Market cap: $184.5M. Range position at entry: 77%. MYX posted the highest volume-to-market-cap ratio among the top 3 at 0.27, and the move from sub-$1 to $1.82 represented a clean near-double. Notably, MYX also appeared on last week's screener — this is a name showing persistent multi-week momentum.
          </p>

          <h3>3. RPL (Rocket Pool) — peaked at +85.6% (24h)</h3>
          <p>
            Entered the screener on Monday. Price at entry: $2.30. Peak price: $3.15. 24h volume at entry: $10.3M. Market cap: $50.0M. Range position at entry: 100%. RPL entered at the absolute top of its range — full breakout territory — and continued pushing. It also re-entered the screener on Tuesday at $2.80 with a +63.4% peak, confirming multi-day continuation. Small cap, top of range, consecutive screener entries: this is the exact profile of sustained momentum.
          </p>

          <h2>Market Cap Breakdown</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Large cap ($1B+):</strong> 71 entries (12%) — down from 18% last week</li>
            <li><strong>Mid cap ($100M–$1B):</strong> 242 entries (40%) — down slightly from 44%</li>
            <li><strong>Small cap (under $100M):</strong> 290 entries (48%) — up significantly from 38%</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Small caps dominated this week, making up nearly half of all entries — up 10 percentage points from last week. Large caps dropped from 18% to 12%. This rotation toward smaller tokens is consistent with a market environment where altcoin speculation is running ahead of major-cap moves. The top 3 entries were all sub-$200M market cap, with two under $65M.
          </p>

          <h2>Volume-to-Market-Cap Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            The average 24h-volume-to-market-cap ratio across all 603 entries was <strong>0.16</strong> — identical to last week. Only <strong>26 entries (4.3%)</strong> had a ratio above 0.5, compared to 40 entries (4.0%) last week. The consistency of this ratio week-over-week suggests a stable baseline of trading intensity across the broader altcoin market, with speculative excess confined to a small percentage of entries.
          </p>

          <h2>Activity Spike: Friday</h2>
          <p>
            The most striking pattern this week was Friday's surge to <strong>210 entries</strong> — more than triple Thursday's 58 entries and the highest single-day count of the week. The week followed a descending-then-explosive pattern: steady Monday-Tuesday (115–122 entries), a slide through Wednesday and Thursday (92 and 58 entries), then a massive Friday rebound.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thursday's dip to just 58 entries — the quietest weekday of the week — followed by Friday's 210-entry explosion is a pattern worth watching. Sharp drops in screener activity often precede sharp rebounds, as the "compression" in qualifying tickers sets up a bigger release when momentum returns. Saturday's 6 entries suggest the Friday surge was already cooling by the weekend.
          </p>

          <h2>Multi-Day Movers</h2>
          <p>
            Like the stock screener this week, crypto showed notable multi-day persistence among top movers. RPL entered Monday (+85.6%) and Tuesday (+63.4%). GRX Chain appeared Tuesday (+55.6%) and Wednesday (+57.0% — actually increasing its peak gain on the second entry). MYX Finance appeared this week and also appeared on last week's screener — multi-week momentum.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of the top 10 entries, 4 were re-entries from tickers that had already appeared earlier in the week. This reinforces the pattern we've been tracking: the strongest momentum often isn't a one-day event but a multi-session trend.
          </p>
