        Here's a look at the crypto assets that showed the strongest momentum on StockJelli's screener this week. This report recaps what moved, the volume behind it, and how screener activity broke down by day. All data is pulled directly from StockJelli's screener logs.
      </p>

      <h2>Week Overview</h2>
      <p>
        StockJelli's crypto screener flagged <strong>288 unique coins</strong> across <strong>616 total entries</strong> this week — roughly flat with last week's 603 entries. Average peak gain was elevated due to a few extreme outliers; excluding those, the typical entry saw gains consistent with recent weeks. The week's defining feature was a massive Wednesday spike that produced nearly half of all entries in a single day.

          <h2>Top 3 Screener Entries This Week</h2>
          <p>Ranked by peak 24-hour percentage gain at the time each coin appeared on StockJelli's screener.</p>

          <h3>1. CFG (Centrifuge) — peaked at +205.4% (24h)</h3>
          <p>
            Entered the screener on Wednesday. Price at entry: $0.0869. Peak price: $0.2649. 24h volume at entry: $1.2M. Market cap: $50.1M. Range position at entry: 82%. A small-cap DeFi protocol that tripled from its screener entry price. The volume was modest at $1.2M, but against a $50M market cap that still represents meaningful trading activity. The 82% range position at entry means CFG was already running when the screener flagged it — and it still had another 200% to go.
          </p>

          <h3>2. POWER (Power Protocol) — peaked at +164.5% (24h)</h3>
          <p>
            Entered the screener on Thursday at 12:02 AM ET. Price at entry: $0.939. Peak price: $2.29. 24h volume at entry: $26.2M. Market cap: $197.2M. Range position at entry: 58%. POWER has become a recurring name on StockJelli — it appeared last week and the week before as well. This week's move from $0.94 to $2.29 was its strongest yet. The mid-range entry (58%) with heavy volume ($26.2M against a $197M cap = 0.13 vol/mcap ratio) paints a picture of genuine accumulation rather than a low-liquidity spike.
          </p>

          <h3>3. ESP (Espresso) — peaked at +157.4% (24h)</h3>
          <p>
            Entered the screener on Tuesday at 12:01 AM ET. Price at entry: $0.0969. Peak price: $0.2207. 24h volume at entry: $111.5M. Market cap: $50.3M. Range position at entry: 54%. ESP was this week's highest-volume top mover — $111.5M in 24h volume against a $50M market cap gives a volume-to-market-cap ratio of 2.22, the most extreme we've seen in the top 3 in weeks. ESP also appeared on the screener Wednesday (+78.5%) and Monday (+53.8%), making it a triple-entry for the week.
          </p>

          <h2>Market Cap Breakdown</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Large cap ($1B+):</strong> 89 entries (14%) — up slightly from 12% last week</li>
            <li><strong>Mid cap ($100M–$1B):</strong> 243 entries (39%) — roughly flat</li>
            <li><strong>Small cap (under $100M):</strong> 284 entries (46%) — down slightly from 48%</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The market cap distribution was nearly identical to last week, with small caps still dominant at 46%. The top 3 performers were all sub-$200M — and two were under $55M. This continued small-cap concentration in the top movers is consistent with a market environment where speculative capital is rotating aggressively through smaller tokens looking for outsized percentage returns.
          </p>

          <h2>Volume-to-Market-Cap Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            The average 24h-volume-to-market-cap ratio across all 616 entries was <strong>0.18</strong> — up slightly from 0.16 the past two weeks. <strong>29 entries (4.7%)</strong> had a ratio above 0.5, compared to 26 (4.3%) last week. The slight uptick in the average ratio suggests marginally increased speculative intensity, though the proportion of extreme-ratio entries remained low. ESP's 2.22 ratio was a notable outlier — when volume exceeds 2x the entire market cap in a single day, it signals extremely active trading relative to the asset's size.
          </p>

          <h2>Wednesday Surge: 276 Entries</h2>
          <p>
            Wednesday produced <strong>276 entries</strong> — nearly 45% of the week's total in a single day, and the highest single-day count we've seen in three weeks of reporting. For context:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Monday (2026-02-23):</strong> 58 entries</li>
            <li><strong>Tuesday (2026-02-24):</strong> 132 entries</li>
            <li><strong>Wednesday (2026-02-25):</strong> 276 entries</li>
            <li><strong>Thursday (2026-02-26):</strong> 133 entries</li>
            <li><strong>Friday (2026-02-27):</strong> 17 entries (day still in progress)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The pattern follows a now-familiar shape: moderate start, sharp mid-week escalation, gradual cooldown. Monday's 58 entries doubled to 132 on Tuesday, then surged to 276 on Wednesday before settling back to 133 on Thursday. This mid-week spike pattern has appeared in two of the three weeks we've tracked — suggesting that crypto momentum may have a structural tendency to peak mid-week as global trading activity overlaps across time zones.
          </p>

          <h2>Multi-Week Persistence</h2>
          <p>
            Three standout tokens appeared on the screener across multiple weeks: POWER (Power Protocol) has now appeared in the top 10 three weeks running — W07, W08, and W09. ESP (Espresso) hit the screener three separate times this week alone (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday), each with a peak gain above +50%. And ENSO entered at the top of its range on Wednesday with $521M in 24h volume — one of the highest raw volume figures of any entry this week.
          </p>
          <p>
            The multi-week persistence of POWER is particularly notable. It's showing the exact pattern the upcoming re-entry alert feature is designed to surface: a token that keeps qualifying for the screener week after week, each time with meaningful gains, indicating sustained institutional or community-driven momentum rather than a one-off pump.
          </p>
