        Here's a look at the stocks that showed the strongest momentum on StockJelli's screener this week. This report recaps what moved, the volume behind it, and the stats from all screener entries. All data is pulled directly from StockJelli's screener logs.
      </p>

      <h2>Week Overview</h2>
      <p>
        StockJelli's screener flagged <strong>100 unique stocks</strong> across <strong>116 total entries</strong> this week — down from 186 entries last week, but with a higher average peak gain of <strong>+25.2%</strong> (up from +24.3%). Fewer entries but stronger individual moves — a quality-over-quantity week.
      </p>

        <div class="blog-paywall-blurred" id="paywallBlurred">

          <h2>Top 3 Screener Entries This Week</h2>
          <p>Ranked by peak percentage gain from the time each stock first appeared on StockJelli's screener.</p>

          <h3>1. RXT (Rackspace Technology) — peaked at +308.1% from screener entry</h3>
          <p>
            Entered the screener on Wednesday at 10:10 AM ET. Price at entry: $1.21. Peak price: $1.71. Volume on entry day: 197.6M shares — by far the highest volume of any stock entry this week. Market cap: $294.7M. Range position at entry: 58%. RXT dominated the week with extraordinary volume — 197.6M shares is roughly 25x a typical session for this name. The stock entered mid-range, suggesting the move was still developing when the screener flagged it. RXT appeared again on Friday at $1.63 with a peak of $2.05 (+67.3%), showing strong multi-day continuation — exactly the kind of re-entry pattern we're building toward tracking automatically.
          </p>

          <h3>2. PLYX (Polaryx Therapeutics) — peaked at +105.8% from screener entry</h3>
          <p>
            Entered the screener on Monday at 9:34 AM ET. Price at entry: $3.26. Peak price: $4.96. Volume on entry day: 13.0M shares. Market cap: $153.5M. Range position at entry: 45%. A small biotech that more than doubled from its screener entry price. The 45% range position at entry is notable — it entered in the middle of its range rather than near the top, meaning the move had significant room to run.
          </p>

          <h3>3. ATOM (Atomera) — peaked at +64.0% from screener entry</h3>
          <p>
            Entered the screener on Monday (Presidents' Day) at 9:30 AM ET. Price at entry: $3.92. Volume on entry day: 28.3M shares. Market cap: $124.2M. Range position at entry: 93%. ATOM also showed multi-day strength — it re-entered the screener on Tuesday at $4.53 and peaked at $6.11 (+55.9%). Like RXT, this is a ticker that hit the screener on consecutive days, each time with meaningful gains. Two of the top 5 entries this week were re-entries.
          </p>

          <h2>Market Cap Breakdown</h2>
          <p>This week saw a notable shift toward mid-cap names compared to last week's large-cap dominance:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Large cap ($1B+):</strong> 52 entries (45%) — down from 60% last week</li>
            <li><strong>Mid cap ($100M–$1B):</strong> 64 entries (55%) — up from 40% last week</li>
            <li><strong>Small cap (under $100M):</strong> 0 entries (0%)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The shift from 60/40 large/mid last week to 45/55 this week suggests momentum rotated into smaller, more volatile names. Mid-caps typically offer larger percentage moves, which aligns with the higher average peak gain this week despite fewer total entries.
          </p>

          <h2>Volume Observations</h2>
          <p>
            Average volume across all 116 entries was <strong>7.8M shares</strong> — up significantly from 5.5M last week. The jump is heavily influenced by RXT's monster 197.6M share day, but even excluding that outlier, volume was elevated. CRSR (Corsair Gaming) posted 46.8M shares, RXT's Friday re-entry hit 43.5M, and ATOM's Sunday entry logged 28.3M. Four entries exceeded 25M shares this week, compared to three last week.
          </p>
          <p>
            The combination of higher average volume and higher average peak gains supports the thesis that volume intensity correlates with move quality — when big volume shows up, the moves tend to be bigger and more sustained.
          </p>

          <h2>Activity Pattern</h2>
          <p>
            Screener activity built throughout the week, starting slow and accelerating:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Monday (2026-02-16):</strong> 8 entries — Presidents' Day, market closed but pre-market data captured</li>
            <li><strong>Tuesday (2026-02-17):</strong> 23 entries</li>
            <li><strong>Wednesday (2026-02-18):</strong> 32 entries — the busiest day</li>
            <li><strong>Thursday (2026-02-19):</strong> 27 entries</li>
            <li><strong>Friday (2026-02-20):</strong> 26 entries</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Wednesday's spike to 32 entries — the busiest day of the week — shows momentum building mid-week after the Presidents' Day holiday. Monday's 8 entries came from pre-market activity on the holiday itself, then activity jumped to 23 on Tuesday as the regular session resumed. The rest of the week was steady in the mid-to-high 20s.
          </p>

          <h2>Multi-Day Movers</h2>
          <p>
            A standout pattern this week: two of the top 5 entries were re-entries from tickers that had already appeared on the screener earlier in the week. RXT entered Wednesday (+308%) and again Friday (+67.3%). ATOM entered Monday (+64.0%) and again Tuesday (+55.9%). This persistent, multi-session momentum is exactly what the upcoming re-entry alert feature is designed to flag. Tickers that keep qualifying for the screener across multiple days are showing the kind of sustained strength that often represents the best swing trade setups.
          </p>
