        Here's a look at the stocks that showed the strongest momentum on StockJelli's screener this week. This report recaps what moved, the volume behind it, and the stats from all screener entries. All data is pulled directly from StockJelli's screener logs.
      </p>

      <h2>Week Overview</h2>
      <p>
        StockJelli's screener flagged <strong>152 unique stocks</strong> across <strong>164 total entries</strong> this week — a significant rebound from last week's 116 entries, and close to the 186 we saw two weeks ago. Average peak gain from screener entry was <strong>+24.0%</strong>, consistent with the prior two weeks. This was a well-distributed week — activity was spread across all five trading sessions rather than concentrated on a single day.
      </p>

          <h2>Top 3 Screener Entries This Week</h2>
          <p>Ranked by peak percentage gain from the time each stock first appeared on StockJelli's screener.</p>

          <h3>1. ANPA (Rich Sparkle Holdings) — peaked at +92.0% from screener entry</h3>
          <p>
            Entered the screener on Tuesday at 10:54 AM ET. Price at entry: $13.89. Peak price: $15.70. Volume on entry day: 1.0M shares. Market cap: $173.6M. Range position at entry: 90%. A mid-cap name that entered near the top of its range and continued pushing — the 90% range position at entry suggests this was already in strong breakout territory when the screener flagged it. The relatively low volume (1M shares) compared to the magnitude of the move makes this an interesting setup to watch for follow-through.
          </p>

          <h3>2. RXT (Rackspace Technology) — peaked at +84.4% from screener entry</h3>
          <p>
            Entered the screener on Thursday at 9:34 AM ET. Price at entry: $1.57. Peak price: $2.49. Volume on entry day: 21.9M shares. Market cap: $382.4M. Range position at entry: 38%. RXT is becoming a recurring name on StockJelli — this is the third consecutive week it's appeared in the top 10. Last week it posted +308% and +67% on two separate entries. This week's entry at a 38% range position suggests it was pulling back before resuming its uptrend, a classic continuation pattern. The persistent, multi-week momentum on this name is exactly the kind of pattern the upcoming re-entry alert feature is designed to highlight.
          </p>

          <h3>3. KORE (KORE Group Holdings) — peaked at +78.8% from screener entry</h3>
          <p>
            Entered the screener on Friday at 11:25 AM ET. Price at entry: $8.96. Peak price: $8.96. Volume on entry day: 2.3M shares. Market cap: $157.2M. Range position at entry: 50%. KORE entered right at the midpoint of its range with a nearly 79% peak gain — the mid-range entry is notable because it suggests the stock had equal room to run in either direction, and it chose up decisively.
          </p>

          <h2>Market Cap Breakdown</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Large cap ($1B+):</strong> 84 entries (51%) — up from 45% last week</li>
            <li><strong>Mid cap ($100M–$1B):</strong> 80 entries (49%) — down from 55%</li>
            <li><strong>Small cap (under $100M):</strong> 0 entries (0%)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The market cap split returned to near-parity this week after last week's mid-cap dominance. The rotation back toward large caps (51% vs 45% last week) suggests institutional-grade names are re-entering the momentum picture. Notable large-cap entries included ACLX (Arcellx) at $6.6B market cap with a +78.2% peak gain and AAOI (Applied Optoelectronics) at $5.0B with +55.5%.
          </p>

          <h2>Volume Observations</h2>
          <p>
            Average volume across all 164 entries was <strong>5.2M shares</strong> — down from last week's 7.8M but back in line with the 5.5M we saw two weeks ago. Last week's elevated average was driven by RXT's 197M share outlier. This week's volume profile was more evenly distributed, with RXT again leading at 21.9M shares, followed by BFLY (Butterfly Network) at 10.4M and VNDA (Vanda Pharmaceuticals) at 9.2M.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two largest peak gains this week (ANPA +92%, KORE +78.8%) came on relatively modest volume — both under 2.5M shares. This is worth monitoring: low-volume, high-gain entries can signal either genuine breakouts in thin names or moves that are more susceptible to reversal. Volume confirmation matters, and the 🔥 volume surge indicator on the screener is designed to help distinguish between the two.
          </p>

          <h2>Activity Pattern</h2>
          <p>
            Activity was well-distributed across the week with a Thursday peak:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Monday (2026-02-23):</strong> 25 entries</li>
            <li><strong>Tuesday (2026-02-24):</strong> 35 entries</li>
            <li><strong>Wednesday (2026-02-25):</strong> 32 entries</li>
            <li><strong>Thursday (2026-02-26):</strong> 44 entries — the busiest day</li>
            <li><strong>Friday (2026-02-27):</strong> 28 entries</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Thursday's 44 entries — roughly 40% above the daily average — was the week's peak. Unlike last week's Presidents' Day-disrupted calendar, this was a clean five-day trading week with a steady build from Monday (25) through Thursday (44) before tapering on Friday (28). The mid-week acceleration is a pattern we've seen frequently: momentum tends to build as the week progresses and institutional traders deploy capital.
          </p>

          <h2>Multi-Week Persistence</h2>
          <p>
            RXT's third consecutive week on the top 10 is the standout story. Over three weeks, this stock has produced screener entries at +308%, +67%, and +84% — showing sustained momentum that spans well beyond a single session. IBRX (ImmunityBio) also appeared on both Monday and Tuesday this week after appearing last week, showing multi-week continuation at the $6B+ market cap level.
          </p>

          <h2>Weekly Stats</h2>
          <ul>

            <li>Unique symbols: <strong>152</strong></li>
